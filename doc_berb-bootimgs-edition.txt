## Editing boot images with yabit is NOT working
## Editing boot images with abootimg is NOT working
## Editing boot images with mkbootimg is WORKING
## Editing boot images with magiskboot is WORKING

## Working process ##
# For unpacking i'm using magiskboot:
  - magiskboot unpack -n boot-orig.img  # I'm using -n since i don't want decompress the kernel and initram images 
# For packing i'm using mkbootimg using my shell script frontend which supplies all offsets and version arguments
  - berb-bootimg-mkbootimg-creator-<device_target>.sh

## mkbootimg ##
The version in Debian Bookworm repository works fine
USEFULL:
- Create a boot image from scratch. All the offset tipes can be specified as arguments, including the header_version nd dtb offset.
- Can edit the cmdline.
WORKING: The resuling imge boots fine.

## magiskboot ##
Usefull to extract boot.img, but also acan repack
"repack" works fine and the output img boots
LIMITATIONS: Can not edit the cmdline
- Unpack the bootimg:
  - magiskboot unpack [-n to not deompress images] boot-orig.img 
- Repack the bootimg:
  - Will repack original img, replace the files with the ones found in current dir, and creates a new image.
  - If the files are compressed, they will be added directly.
  - If the files are uncompressed, they will be compressed detecting the compression type from the original img.
  - if PATCHVBMETAFLAG is set to true, all disable flags in the boot image's vbmeta header will be set.
  - magiskboot repack [-n to not recompress images] boot-orig.img boot-new.img 
- Merge dtb + kernel?
  -magiskboot split <image-dtb>
- Print dtb image
  - magiskboot-arm64 dtb dtb-image print
